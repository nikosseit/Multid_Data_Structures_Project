This project was implemented during the fourth year of my undergraduate program. It implements two types of multidimensional trees, R trees and Range trees, along with essential functions for inserting, deleting, updating, and searching values within these trees. Developed in Python, the project leverages libraries that enable efficient handling of multidimensional data, with data loaded from a dataset in Excel.This project demonstrates foundational knowledge in data structures and algorithm design, with a focus on managing complex, multidimensional datasets.

In making the program Winograd was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient ""understanding"" to be able to use natural language. Winograd built a blocks world , restricting the program's intellectual world to a simulated ""world of toy blocks"". The program could accept commands such as, ""Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box"" and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, ""I do not know which block you mean."" The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer's semantic memory by hand and how limited or ""brittle"" such programs are."
Wolfram,1,"Wolfram was educated at Eton College , but left prematurely in 1976. As a young child, Wolfram had difficulties learning arithmetic. At the age of 12, he wrote a directory of physics. By age 14, he had written three books on particle physics. He entered St. John's College, Oxford , at age 17 and left in 1978 without graduating to attend the California Institute of Technology the following year, where he received a PhD in particle physics in 1980. Wolfram's thesis committee was composed of Richard Feynman , Peter Goldreich , Frank J. Sciulli and Steven Frautschi , and chaired by Richard D. Field ."
